## ESP8266 ESP-12 NodeMCU Lua WiFi

Easy [tutorial](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther)    


I've install the arduino IDE from the [link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) instead of doing apt-get install.
In linux i've add some trouble with a particular cable, that was good enought to power the Nodemcu but bad enought for my system to not recognize the serial port.
